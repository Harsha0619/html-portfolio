<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My self Harshavardhan Sanaboena, I was born and raised in Manuguru which is a part of Bhardradri Kothagudem. I did my schooling in Holy Family High School, Manuguru. After completing secondary education, I joined Sri Chaitanya Junior College in M.P.C. course. I successfully completed the intermediate course and later joined an engineering college. </p>

<p>I got into Kakatiya Institute Of Technology & Science, Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department. The college was located at Warangal of Telangana State. It was a 4 years course and almost most of the time I was in the college, as the residence(hostel) was a part of the college. I learned a lot from the college like my goals, what I got to do and where I look forward to see my future self. After successful completion of graduation, I made a decision to get into defence services.  </p>

<p>After making the choice to get into defence services, I attended various exams and selections, but got rejected or disqualified. It took sometime that there are more than one way to achieve my job. So I took an online course and studied for the competitive exams of both public and private organisation. But the hard part was coping with the failure at every step. But failure is not the end of the journey and I've to search for my way. Maybe its goona take sometime, but I'll reach that point one day. </p>
